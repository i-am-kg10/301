        <h1>Education!</h1>
        <p>Over the years I have been lucky enough to attend a wide variety of academic institutions. During my childhood I was enrolled in Stoneybrooke Christian Schools a small school located in Ladara Ranch, California. Later, I attended Sage Hill School, a newly formed private school in Newport Beach, where I had the opportunity to learn and grow with the school.</p>
		<p>Currently I am on track to earn a Dual Degree from USC, a Bachlor of Science in Economomics and in Mathematics, as well as a Bachlor of Arts in Political Science and a Web Development minor. I hope to use these degrees to help pave my way towards a career in Finance, eventually Wall Street.For my freshman year of college I moved Washington DC where I attended George Washington University. Living in DC was an incredible experience, however due to family circumstances I had to move back to Californian and thus I transferred to USC.  </p>

        <p class="lead">Studying at George Washington was an incredible experience. The dorm I lived in was across the street from the World Bank, one block away from the International Monetary Fund, and three blocks away from the White House.  I had such an incredible experience there, that I had to go back, and the summer following my sophomore year I participated in a program that enabled me to study and work in Washington again.</p>

The Duel Degree program of the school has allowed me to take more classes and earn more degrees that I could have possibly gained elsewhere, while the Trojan network has proven to be an incredible asset in aiding me finding internships and further my professional goals.</p>
